This repository contains my PowerPoint presentation on **Turbofan Engines**,  
prepared by **GAJA Koushik** as part of my learning journey in aerospace and mechanical engineering.

 📌 Contents
- `Jet engines (TURBO-JET) by GAJA Koushik.pptx` – Full presentation with diagrams and explanations.

# Key Topics Covered
- Introduction to turbofan engines  
- Why turbofans are preferred in fighter jets (fuel efficiency, maneuverability, thrust boost)  
- Materials used in engine construction (titanium alloys, nickel-based superalloys, composites)  
- Working principle:
  - Low-Pressure Spool (Fan, LPC, LPT)  
  - High-Pressure Spool (HPC, HPT)  
  - Stationary components (stators, vanes, nacelle)  
- Role of the afterburner in combat performance  
- Real examples: Tejas Mk1/Mk1A, MiG-23, GE F404-IN20 turbofan  

# 🎯 Purpose
This presentation was created to strengthen my understanding of **air-breathing jet engines**  
with a focus on turbofan engines used in modern fighter aircraft.  

I am building this GitHub repository to:  
- Document my learning in aerospace propulsion.  
- Share my work publicly.  
- Use it as part of my professional portfolio for internships and career opportunities in aerospace (e.g., DRDO, HAL, ISRO, or private aerospace firms).
